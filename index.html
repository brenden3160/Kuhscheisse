    <h1> Welcome to my Website!</h1>
    
    <p> I have been working with computer code since I was 15 and I coded my first robot. Since then I have picked up a thing or two
      about the inside of a computer's brain. Through many hours of pratice and dedication in and outside of school, I have 
      gained familiarity with several coding languages that can be used in real-life application.</p>
    <p>The following are computer languages which I understand:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li> HTMK (Hyperlink Text Markup Language)</li>
      <li> CSS (Cascading Sheet Styles) </li>
      <li> C++ </li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p> More information about these languages is provided in the links below.</p>
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">More information about HTML</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">More information about CSS</a></li>
      <li><a href= "https://www.w3schools.in/cplusplus-tutorial/intro.asp">More informatuon about C++</a></li>

    <p>Although learning to code is frustrating at first, the reward is much worth the struggle of learning because there are
      endless things that one can to with the knowledge.</p>
