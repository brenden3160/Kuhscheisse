    <h1> Welcome to my Throwback-themed Website!</h1>
    <p> Yes, yes. I know this website appears as if an elementary schooler made it, but perhaps this is 
      because my website building skills match those of an elementary schooler. In fact, in the 1990's, most websites 
      appeared mediocre at best by today's standards. But this is 2018, and I'm hoping to prove my abilities to code with two languages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> HTML (Hyperlink Text Markup Language) </li>
      <li> CSS (Cascading Sheet Styles) </li>
    </ul> 
    <p> More information about these languages is provided in the links below.</p>
