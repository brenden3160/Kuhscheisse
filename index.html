    <h1> Welcome to my Throwback-themed Website!</h1>
    
    <p> Yes, yes. I know this website appears as if an elementary schooler made it, but perhaps this is 
      because my website building skills match those of an elementary schooler. In fact, in the 1990's, it was common for websites to
      appear mediocre at best by today's standards. But this is 2018 and the internet has become a more beautiful place due to
      a handful of technological improvements. I am currently learning how to use two of these languages:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li> HTML (Hyperlink Text Markup Language) </li>
      <li> CSS (Cascading Sheet Styles) </li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p> More information about these languages is provided in the links below.</p>
    <ul>
