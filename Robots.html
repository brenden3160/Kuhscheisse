    <h1> My Education</h1>
 <p>Since I was in middle school, I have been curious about how computer work and the possibilities of what they can do. Naturally, I 
   was attracted to the idea of robotics. Over the years, I have also acquired computer skills beyond robotics by learning more languages.</p>
    <p>I have been building and coding robots for several years now. Here are a few of my favorites:</p>

      <button type="button" onclick= "startTime()"> Click me to display Time. </button>
      <p id="demo"></p>

    <p> One of the msot useful classes that I have taken to learn about coding is my intro to computer science class. Below is a 
    paper I wrote elaborating on some of what I learned from it.</p>
